				<p class="heading-description">
					How many neurons are there in the brain? This simple question has thrown up many conflicted and widely dissimilar answers for years. Recent technological advancement has answered with reasonable confidence of it being closer to the truth than a creative guess.  Armed with this knowledge, scientists are trying to understand whether the number of neurons in the brain reflects an organism's behaviour. <br>An early assumption was that; heavier the brain, the "smarter" the animal. It is hard to define what "smart" is, as there is no universal scale to measure all animal's cognitive capacities. It is indeed true that "one cannot judge a fish by its tree climbing skills".<br> Ignoring such nuance, it is fruitful to compare different animals with varying body and brain mass and see how they correlate with diferent parameters of the brain. The brain mass does increase with body mass, but only to a limit. <br>Counting the number of neurons also correlates with an organism's behavioural repertoire, up to an extent. One can go further deeper by counting neurons in only a certain part of the brain, since different parts have different functions. We can now count the number of neurons in the part of the brain that is involved with higher cognitive functions separately and the brain part that controls the body movements separately.<br> This helps us to get a better understanding of how the behaviour of the organism could be reflected in the distribution and the ratio of neurons in various parts. 

					<br> <br> <br> <br>
					To visualize these connections better, we have created an "interactive comparative digital neuroanatomy" visualization. We have used data from the research of the Brazilian neuroscientist Dr Suzana Herculano-Houzel's group. Her team has dissected brains of many organisms and extracted cell numbers from many organisms. Our visualization compares cell numbers (neuronal/non-neuronal) for different brain parts (cortex/cerebellum/rest of the brain) with the organism's body/brain mass. This approach gives many valuable insights into the neuronal composition of different parts of the brains in terms of body/brain mass and in comparison with other animals within and between evolutionary clades.

						<div class="block-text" id="sec1-1">
The animals are numbered and arranged according to body weight. The left-most animal is the heaviest (Elephant) studied, and the rightmost is the lightest (Smokey Shrew). When you place your mouse over the first animal, elephant. A pink line appears connecting each of the horizontal bars. It shows the ranking of this animal on all four parameters. We see that the elephant is highest in body mass/brain mass, cerebellum neurons, but only 4th in cortex neurons. 
						</div>

						<div class="block-text" id="sec1-2">
							You can also find out which animal is ranked in each parameter - for example, if you want to know which is the animal ranked 25th on brain mass. Place the mouse on the 25th tick on the "brain mass" horizontal line. The pink line will show which animal it is. In this case it is a dog that is ranked 25th on brain mass. The line also will show other ranks for the dog (19th - body mass, 24th - neurons in cerebellum and 26th - total neurons and 25th- neurons in cortex. 

						</div>

						<div class="block-text" id="sec1-3">
							The rabbit is interesting, it is 14th in body mass, but the pink line is shifted to the right for all measures, which means that all measures are ranked lower. The rabbit has its brain parameters equivalent to a lighter animal. The shift of the pink rightwards says that the animal has smaller body/brain mass and numbers and a shift to the right means they have body/brain mass/numbers larger for their body weight (like Humans, Gorillas, Rhesus Macaque)

					Looking at the ratio of two parameters can give further insight into this data. The ratio of neurons and non-neuronal cells in the whole brain could differentiate between brains of the same size. Although heavier animals have heavier brains, the relationship is not straightforward. Similar complications remain for the size of the brain and the number of neurons.

							First, choose two parameters, you want to compare. Then click on the animal you want to compare against the rest of the animals. The illustration of the animal will appear to the left of the circle, and on the horizontal visualization below the circle, the organism will move to the leftmost positions. 
						</div>

						<div class="block-text" id="sec2-2" style="margin-bottom: 50vh;">
							Suppose you choose the ratio between brain mass/body mass and choose human as the anchor animal. The three animals with the closest ratios will appear connected with blue lines of thickness proportional to their strength of relationship (rhesus macaque, mouse lemur and common marmoset). The three animals with the farthest ratios will appear with red lines of varying thickness reflecting their relationship (Pig, Elephant and Hamster). The colour in the inner line shows the order/clade the animal belongs to.
